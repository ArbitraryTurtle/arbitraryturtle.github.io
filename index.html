                 	<h3>What is it?</h3>
            		<p>Soul Emission is an 2D atmospheric sci-fi shooter on multiple platforms.</p>
            		<h3>Story</h3>
                        <p>You are an astronaut in 2358 on a solitary mission to discover new planets. When orbiting planet E030U596 your ship comes into contact with a small, acidic object then burns through your ship's hull. It's spores burst open and spread a toxic gas throughout the entire ship, killing you. Luckily you were wearing your company's special suit, Soul Emission. The suit allows you to stay alive in a ghost like form until you reconnect with you body. Soul Emission is a new technology, so it's limited in the fact that you are uploaded in a special part of the ship, away from your body and you can only tap into the ghost power for a moment, elsewise leaving you mortal. Why bother finding your body? You will do in a few days if you don't. The acidic object carried bacteria that evolved at an astonishing rate and will attack anything other than themselves on sight.</p>
            		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
                        <p>
                        <span id = "underline">Main Objective</span><br>
                            The main focus of the gameplay is to move though different parts of the ship by finding the door's activator until you find your beloved body.
                        <br><span id = "underline">Gun Mechanics</span><br>
                            The gun is fully automatic and has different bullet types that completely balanced to fit your preferred play style. Each bullet type has a different look and sound. You can switch out your ammo type at stations that appear frequently.                   
                        <br><span id = "underline">Length</span><br>
                            The demo is around 20 minutes and the full game will be about 2 hours.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Enemies</h3>
                        <p>
                        <span id = "underline">Pointy Legs</span><br>
                            This enemy has an average movement speed and attacks you by swinging down its long, sharp arms when in close proximity. 
                        <br><span id = "underline">Four Eyes</span><br>
                            Attaches itself to the ceiling, drops down when you get near it and injures you whenever you are in contact with it. 
                        <br><span id = "underline">Explodetaur</span><br>
                            With little value for it's own life it quickly charges at you and explodes when you enter the explosion radius.
             		<h3>Technical</h3>
